## Usage

On startup, URCDA uses `URLCDA_TOKEN` environment variable to login and prints basic info such as servier invite and user install links.

To clean the URLs in a message, right click the message, click "apps", then choose your desired "Clean URLs" commands.

Each command corresponds to a profile, with the plain "Clean URLs" being the base profile and "Clean URLs (profile_name)" being the profile named "profile_name".
